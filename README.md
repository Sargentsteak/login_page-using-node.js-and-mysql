# login_page-using-node.js-and-mysql
A login page which can be used for any website
This is a bit lengthy process , please bear with me
so first of all lets install all the basic dependancies

You need to have nodejs , mysql and xammp server installed on your pc 

first of all create a new folder of your choice 
cd file_name
code . 

npm -i install express mysql dotenv jsonwebtoken bcrypt router
I may have left out some functionalities you can install them during debugging

This will install all the basic dependancies and you are ready to go with the code
Ive given you the main framework . Ive not "decorated" the webdite , I leave that to you.

Happy coding!!
